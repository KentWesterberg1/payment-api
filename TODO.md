# TO DO

* Change Example code so that it uses proper keys, by default accessing the Acceptance environment. 
* Check status of the "security5" implementations. Really needed?
* Change SHA-1 to SHA-256
* Change implementation to not use X.509 certificates, but rather RSA keys.

API:
* BigInteger in addition to Double
* setAutoCapture(boolean) instead of setTransactionType(Authorize/Debit)
* Builder

## Remember
* Backwards compatibility is important.
